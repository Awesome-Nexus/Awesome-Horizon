## Founders of Chemistry

### Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) - "Father of Modern Chemistry"

**Biography:**
Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier was born on August 26, 1743, in Paris, France, to a wealthy noble family. He received his education at the Collège des Quatre-Nations (Collège Mazarin) in Paris, where he studied chemistry, botany, astronomy, and mathematics. Despite earning a law degree in 1763, Lavoisier never practiced law, choosing instead to pursue his passion for science.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Oxygen Theory of Combustion**: Disproved the phlogiston theory and discovered that combustion involves combination with oxygen
- **Law of Conservation of Mass**: Confirmed that matter cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions (1789)
- **Chemical Nomenclature**: Co-authored the *Méthode de nomenclature chimique* (1787), establishing modern chemical naming conventions
- **Element Identification**: Named oxygen (1778) and recognized hydrogen as an element (1783)
- **Metric System**: Helped construct the metric system of measurements
- **First Modern Chemistry Textbook**: Published *Traité élémentaire de chimie* (1789)

**Legacy:**
Lavoisier transformed chemistry from a qualitative to a quantitative science. His wife and laboratory assistant, Marie-Anne Paulze Lavoisier, was also a renowned chemist who helped develop the metric system and created detailed engravings of laboratory instruments.

**Tragic End:**
During the French Revolution, Lavoisier was arrested as a member of the Ferme générale (tax collection agency) and guillotined on May 8, 1794, at the age of 50. A year and a half later, he was completely exonerated by the French government. Mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange lamented: "It took them only an instant to cut off this head, and a hundred years might not suffice to reproduce its like."

### Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) - Creator of the Periodic Table

**Biography:**
Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev was born on February 8, 1834, in Verkhnie Aremzyani, near Tobolsk, Siberia, Russia. The youngest of 17 children, Mendeleev faced hardship when his father became blind and lost his teaching position. His mother restarted the family's glass factory to support them. After the factory burned down, she took Mendeleev across Russia to pursue his education in Moscow and later Saint Petersburg.

Mendeleev graduated from the Main Pedagogical Institute in Saint Petersburg in 1855. He became a professor at Saint Petersburg State University in 1865 and achieved tenure in 1867.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Periodic Law**: Formulated the periodic law and created the periodic table of elements in 1869
- **Predicted New Elements**: Accurately predicted the properties of three then-unknown elements: germanium (ekasilicon), gallium (eka-aluminium), and scandium (eka-boron)
- **Corrected Atomic Weights**: Fixed the atomic weight of uranium from 120 to 240
- **Textbook Author**: Wrote *Principles of Chemistry* (1868-1870), the definitive textbook of its time
- **Nomenclature**: Used Sanskrit prefixes (eka, dvi, tri) to name "missing" elements

**The Famous Dream:**
According to Mendeleev, he envisioned the complete arrangement of elements in a dream: "I saw in a dream a table where all elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of paper, only in one place did a correction later seem necessary."

**Legacy:**
Mendeleev never received the Nobel Prize despite being nominated in 1905, 1906, and 1907. Svante Arrhenius opposed his candidacy, arguing the periodic system was too old to recognize. Element 101, Mendelevium (Md), was named in his honor.

### John Dalton (1766-1844) - Atomic Theory Pioneer

**Biography:**
John Dalton was born on September 6, 1766, in Eaglesfield, Cumberland, England, into a Quaker family. His father was a weaver, and the family was too poor to support extensive education. Dalton received early education from his father and Quaker schoolmaster John Fletcher. From age ten, he earned his living in service to wealthy Quaker Elihu Robinson, who sparked his interest in mathematics and meteorology.

Dalton began keeping meteorological records in 1787 and continued for 57 years, accumulating over 200,000 observations. He moved to Manchester in 1793 and joined the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Atomic Theory**: Published *A New System of Chemical Philosophy* (1808), establishing modern atomic theory
- **Five Main Principles**:
  1. Elements are made of extremely small particles called atoms
  2. Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass, and properties
  3. Atoms cannot be subdivided, created, or destroyed
  4. Atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds
  5. In chemical reactions, atoms are combined, separated, or rearranged
- **Dalton's Law**: Formulated the law of partial pressures for gases
- **Color Blindness Research**: First scientific description of color vision deficiency (still called "Daltonism" in several languages)
- **Atomic Weights**: Created the first table of relative atomic weights

**Legacy:**
Dalton was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1822 and received the Royal Medal in 1826. The unit of atomic mass, the dalton (Da), is named in his honor. The Royal Society of Chemistry's inorganic section is called the Dalton Division, with its journal *Dalton Transactions*.

### Robert Boyle (1627-1691) - The Skeptical Chymist

**Biography:**
Robert Boyle was born on January 25, 1627, at Lismore Castle, County Waterford, Ireland. The 14th child of the 1st Earl of Cork, Boyle was educated at Eton College and later traveled extensively in Europe. He settled in Oxford in 1654, where he conducted his most significant scientific work, and later moved to London in 1668.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Boyle's Law**: Established the inverse relationship between pressure and volume of a gas (PV = constant)
- **The Skeptical Chymist** (1661): Landmark book that distinguished chemistry from alchemy and established chemistry as a rigorous science
- **Element Definition**: Defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances
- **Experimental Method**: Championed systematic experimentation and observation
- **Royal Society**: A founding member of the Royal Society of London in 1660

**Legacy:**
Boyle is often regarded as the first modern chemist. His insistence on systematic experimentation and rejection of the four-element theory (earth, air, fire, water) paved the way for modern chemistry.

The first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901.

**Legacy:**
Nobel's invention of dynamite brought him wealth but also criticism. A premature obituary calling him the "merchant of death" reportedly influenced his decision to create the prizes. The Nobel Prize remains the most prestigious award in science.

### Green Chemistry

**12 Principles of Green Chemistry** (Paul Anastas and John Warner, 1998):
1. Prevent waste rather than treat or clean up
2. Design safer synthesis methods
3. Use less hazardous chemical syntheses
4. Design safer chemicals and products
5. Use safer solvents and reaction conditions
6. Design for energy efficiency
7. Use renewable feedstocks
8. Reduce derivatives
9. Use catalysis, not stoichiometric reagents
10. Design for degradation
11. Real-time analysis for pollution prevention
12. Minimize potential for accidents

**Examples:**
- Supercritical CO₂ as a solvent
- Ionic liquids
- Biodegradable plastics
- Solar-powered synthesis
- Enzymatic catalysis
