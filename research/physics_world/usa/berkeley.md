## History

### The Lawrence Era and Birth of "Big Science"

Physics at UC Berkeley entered its modern era when **Ernest O. Lawrence** was recruited from Yale University in 1928. In 1930, Lawrence invented the **cyclotron**, a revolutionary circular particle accelerator that would earn him the **Nobel Prize in Physics in 1939**. This invention marked the beginning of the era of "big science" – large-scale, multi-disciplinary research teams working on ambitious projects.

**Key Historical Milestones:**

|------|-----------|
| 1930 | Ernest Lawrence invents the cyclotron |
| 1931 | Radiation Laboratory (Rad Lab) opens on UC Berkeley campus |
| 1936 | First artificial element (technetium) created at Berkeley |
| 1939 | Lawrence awarded Nobel Prize in Physics; 60-inch cyclotron begins operations |
| 1940 | Discovery of carbon-14, neptunium, and plutonium |
| 1946 | Construction of the 184-inch synchrocyclotron completed |
| 1955 | Discovery of the antiproton by Chamberlain and Segrè |
| 1958 | Lawrence passes away; Lab renamed Lawrence Radiation Laboratory |
| 1960 | Donald Glaser invents the bubble chamber (Nobel Prize 1960) |
| 1968 | Luis Alvarez discovers resonance states (Nobel Prize 1968) |
| 1971 | Lawrence Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore Laboratories separate |
| 2006 | George Smoot awarded Nobel Prize for CMB anisotropy discovery |
| 2011 | Saul Perlmutter awarded Nobel Prize for dark energy discovery |
| 2022 | John Clauser awarded Nobel Prize for quantum entanglement experiments |

The department's tradition of groundbreaking research continued through luminaries such as **J. Robert Oppenheimer**, who led theoretical physics and later directed the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos; **Luis Alvarez**, who developed the hydrogen bubble chamber and discovered numerous elementary particles; and **Donald Glaser**, inventor of the bubble chamber.
