## History

### Founding and Early Years (1890-1940s)

The University of Chicago was established in 1890 through a collaboration between the American Baptist Education Society and John D. Rockefeller, with land donated by Marshall Field. The Physics Department quickly gained prominence under the leadership of **Albert A. Michelson**, the first American to win a Nobel Prize in Physics (1907), who served as the first head of the department.

### The Manhattan Project Era (1940s)

During World War II, the university's **Metallurgical Laboratory** made history as the site of **Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1)**—the world's first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, achieved on December 2, 1942, under the direction of **Enrico Fermi**. This pivotal moment in the Manhattan Project demonstrated the feasibility of nuclear energy and atomic weapons.

Following the war, the university established two major research institutes:
- **The Institute for Nuclear Studies** (1945), later renamed the **Enrico Fermi Institute (EFI)**
- **The Institute for the Study of Metals**, later renamed the **James Franck Institute (JFI)**

These institutes were created to continue the interdisciplinary wartime research efforts and maintain collaboration across traditional departmental boundaries.

### Post-War Expansion and Nobel Legacy

The post-war era saw the University of Chicago Physics Department become a magnet for world-class talent. The department has been associated with **30 Nobel Prizes in Physics**, including:

- **Albert A. Michelson** (1907) - Precision optical instruments
- **Robert A. Millikan** (1923) - Oil drop experiment (at Chicago before moving to Caltech)
- **Arthur H. Compton** (1927) - Compton effect
- **James Franck** (1925) - Franck-Hertz experiment
- **Enrico Fermi** (1938) - Nuclear reactions and artificial radioactivity
- **Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar** (1983) - Stellar structure and evolution
- **James W. Cronin** (1980) - CP violation in K-meson decay
