## NORTH AMERICA

### United States

#### Common Core State Standards

The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, adopted by 41 states, were developed to address the "mile wide and inch deep" criticism of American mathematics curricula. The standards emphasize:

- **Focus**: Deeper learning on fewer concepts at each grade level
- **Coherence**: Connecting learning across grades and linking topics
- **Rigor**: Pursuing conceptual understanding, procedural skills, and application with equal intensity

**Grade-Level Structure:**

| Grade Band | Key Focus Areas |
|------------|-----------------|
| K-2 | Number sense, addition/subtraction, place value |
| 3-5 | Multiplication/division, fractions, decimals |
| 6-7 | Ratios, proportional relationships, early algebra |
| 8 | Linear algebra, functions (gateway to high school math) |
| 9-12 | Algebra I/II, Geometry, Statistics, Calculus |
