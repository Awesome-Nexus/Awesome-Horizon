# Physics in Hungary

## Overview

Hungary has a distinguished tradition in physics that dates back centuries, with a remarkable legacy of scientific excellence despite its relatively small population. The country has produced numerous world-renowned physicists, including multiple Nobel laureates who have fundamentally shaped our understanding of the universe. From Loránd Eötvös's pioneering work on gravitation to Ferenc Krausz's groundbreaking attosecond physics, Hungarian physicists have consistently pushed the boundaries of human knowledge. Today, Hungary maintains a vibrant physics research ecosystem with strong university departments, national research centers, and active participation in international collaborations such as CERN.

The Hungarian physics community is characterized by its strong mathematical foundations, a tradition dating back to the "Martians"—a group of brilliant Hungarian scientists who emigrated to the United States in the early 20th century and made revolutionary contributions to physics, mathematics, and computer science.
