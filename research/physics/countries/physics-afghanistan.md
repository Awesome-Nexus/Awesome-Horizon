# Physics in Afghanistan: Comprehensive Research Report

## Overview

Afghanistan's physics research and education infrastructure has faced significant challenges due to decades of conflict, yet the country maintains a network of university physics departments and has received international support to rebuild its scientific capacity. This report documents the physics landscape in Afghanistan including universities, research centers, societies, notable physicists, and international collaborations.

**Current Status Note:** Following the Taliban takeover in August 2021, Afghanistan's higher education system has experienced severe disruptions, including the suspension of women's university education in December 2022. Many physicists and academics have fled the country, and international collaborations have been significantly affected.

## 8. Challenges and Current Situation

### Major Challenges

1. **Women's Education Ban:** Since December 2022, women are banned from university education
2. **Brain Drain:** Mass exodus of qualified academics and physicists since 2021
3. **Funding Cessation:** International aid and research funding largely suspended
4. **Isolation:** Limited international travel and collaboration opportunities
5. **Equipment Shortage:** Even before 2021, there were no functioning physics labs at Kabul University (as of 2013)
6. **Internet Restrictions:** Periodic nationwide internet shutdowns affect online learning

### Statistics (Pre-2021 vs Current)

| Metric | Pre-2021 | Current (2024) |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| University enrollment | 170,000 (2018) | Severely reduced |
| Female students | ~25% | 0% (banned) |
| International collaborations | Growing | Minimal |
| Physics faculty with PhDs | ~4% | Significantly reduced |

---

## 9. Conclusion

Afghanistan's physics landscape has been severely impacted by decades of conflict, with the situation deteriorating dramatically following the August 2021 Taliban takeover. While the country historically had four major universities offering physics programs (Kabul, Herat, Balkh, and Nangarhar), current operations are limited and international collaborations have been largely suspended.

The work of ICTP's Physics Without Frontiers program represents a lifeline for many Afghan physics students, providing online educational opportunities and international connections. Notable Afghan physicists like Dr. Shakardokht Jafari and Baktash Amini continue to advocate for science education in Afghanistan from abroad.

The future of physics in Afghanistan remains uncertain, dependent on the political situation and the potential for restoration of international scientific cooperation and educational access for all citizens regardless of gender.
