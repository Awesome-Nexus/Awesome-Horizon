## 1. National Physics Societies

### Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (DPG) - German Physical Society

The **Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (DPG)** is the world's oldest organization of physicists and one of the largest physics societies globally.

- **Founded:** 1845 in Berlin
- **Current Membership:** ~50,000 members worldwide (as of 2025)
- **Headquarters:** Physikzentrum Bad Honnef, near Bonn
- **Current President:** Klaus Richter (2024-2026)

**Historical Significance:**
The DPG was founded on January 14, 1845, as the Physical Society of Berlin. Its founding members included prominent scientists such as Gustav Karsten, Emil Du Bois-Reymond, and later, Hermann von Helmholtz. The society played a crucial role in the development of modern physics, particularly during the golden age of quantum mechanics in the 1920s.

- Albert Einstein (1916-1918)
- Arnold Sommerfeld (1919-1920)
- Max von Laue (1931-1933)
- Werner Heisenberg (post-WWII)

**Activities and Awards:**
- **Annual Conferences:** DPG-Frühjahrstagungen (Spring Meetings) held at multiple locations across Germany
