# Physics in Romania

## Overview

Romania has a rich tradition in physics research and education dating back to the late 19th century. The country has made significant contributions to nuclear physics, quantum mechanics, X-ray spectroscopy, and condensed matter physics. Today, Romania maintains a robust physics research infrastructure with major institutes in Măgurele (near Bucharest), Cluj-Napoca, Iași, and Timișoara. Romania became a member state of CERN in 2016 and hosts the ELI-NP (Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics), one of the world's most powerful laser facilities.

## Historical Context

### Pre-1945 Period
The foundations of modern physics in Romania were laid in the interwar period (1918–1939). Physicists like Horia Hulubei, Șerban Țițeica, and Ștefan Procopiu studied at major European centers (Paris, Leipzig) and returned to establish modern physics research and education. The first laboratories for atomic and nuclear physics were established at the University of Iași and University of Bucharest.

### Communist Era (1945–1989)
The Institute of Atomic Physics (IFA) was founded in 1949, rapidly becoming the center of Romanian physics. Despite political pressures and brain drain, Romanian physics achieved international recognition, particularly in nuclear physics. Romania joined JINR Dubna in 1956. The Măgurele research campus developed into a major European physics hub.

### Post-1989 Period
Following the fall of communism, Romanian physics underwent restructuring and integration into European research structures. Key achievements include:
- Romania became CERN Member State (2016)
- ELI-NP was established as a major European research infrastructure
- Integration into European Research Area
- Increased international collaborations
- Modernization of research facilities
