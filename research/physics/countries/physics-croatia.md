# Physics in Croatia

## Overview

Croatia has a rich tradition in physics dating back to the 17th century, with the first physics lectures held at the Jesuit Academy in Zagreb in 1664. The country has made significant contributions to various fields of physics, from theoretical physics and atomic theory to geophysics and particle physics. Croatia is home to the world-renowned Ruđer Bošković Institute, named after the famous 18th-century Croatian polymath who developed an early atomic theory. Today, Croatian physics institutions are actively engaged in international collaborations, particularly with CERN, and participate in cutting-edge research in condensed matter physics, particle physics, astrophysics, and quantum technologies.
