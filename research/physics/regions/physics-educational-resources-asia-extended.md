## Notes on Research Coverage

1. **Data Sources:** This research compiled information from university websites, AAPPS member directory, QS World Rankings, and national education portals.

2. **Physics Societies:** Many countries have national physics societies that are members of AAPPS (Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies). Some smaller countries may not have independent societies.

3. **Online Learning:** MOOC adoption varies significantly across the region. More developed countries (Thailand, Malaysia, Turkey, Iran) have established national platforms, while smaller or less developed nations rely primarily on international platforms.

4. **Conflict-Affected Areas:** Information for Syria, Yemen, and Iraq may be limited due to ongoing conflicts affecting higher education infrastructure.

5. **Language:** Most universities in the region offer some programs in English, particularly at the graduate level, though undergraduate instruction may be in national languages.
