### Whistleblowing Cases

**Roger Boisjoly - Challenger Disaster (1986)**

Roger Boisjoly was a solid rocket booster engineer at Morton Thiokol who warned against launching the Space Shuttle Challenger in cold weather.

**Key Events:**
- Identified O-ring seal vulnerability in SRB joints
- Recommended against launch at temperatures below 53°F
- Management overruled engineering concerns
- After disaster, testified before Rogers Commission
- Became whistleblower advocate for engineering ethics

**Outcome:**
- Isolated professionally for speaking out
- Received American Association for the Advancement of Science Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility (1988)
- Spoke extensively on engineering ethics until his death in 2012

**Legacy:**
- Case study in engineering ethics courses worldwide
- Demonstrated importance of engineer's obligation to public safety
- Highlighted pressure to meet schedules over safety

**Allan McDonald - Challenger Disaster**

Allan McDonald was Morton Thiokol's Director of the Space Shuttle SRM Project at Kennedy Space Center.

**Actions:**
- Refused to sign recommendation to launch
- Documented that he did not agree with launch decision
- Provided critical testimony to Rogers Commission
- Revealed that data about O-ring vulnerability was suppressed

**Legacy:**
- Co-authored "Truth, Lies, and O-Rings"
- Advocated for responsible workplace decision making
- Emphasized engineer's responsibility to speak up

### Challenger Disaster

**Date:** January 28, 1986

**Crew:**
- Francis R. Scobee (Commander)
- Michael J. Smith (Pilot)
- Judith A. Resnik
- Ellison S. Onizuka
- Ronald E. McNair
- Gregory B. Jarvis
- S. Christa McAuliffe (Teacher in Space)

**Technical Cause:**
- O-ring seal failure in right SRB field joint
- Record-low temperatures (36°F / 2°C) stiffened O-rings
- Joint rotation reduced O-ring sealing capability
- Hot gas bypassed seals and burned through external tank

**Organizational Causes (Rogers Commission Findings):**
- NASA's flawed decision-making process
- Communication failures between engineers and management
- Pressure to maintain launch schedule
- Normalization of deviance (accepting O-ring erosion as normal)
- Inadequate safety culture

**Ethics Lessons:**
1. Engineers must hold paramount the safety of the public
2. Technical concerns must reach decision-makers
3. Schedule pressure should never override safety
4. Engineers have obligation to persist in raising safety concerns
5. Management must listen to technical experts

**Changes Resulting from Disaster:**
- Redesigned SRB joints with capture feature
- New NASA Office of Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance
- Crew escape system added for gliding flight
- Commercial satellites launched on expendable vehicles
- Endeavour built to replace Challenger

**Additional Resources:**
- Rogers Commission Report (June 6, 1986)
- Book: "Truth, Lies, and O-Rings" by Allan J. McDonald
- Book: "What Do You Care What Other People Think?" by Richard Feynman
