## History

The history of physics at Princeton began in **1832** when **Joseph Henry**, a watchmaker's apprentice who became a legendary teacher and research pioneer, arrived on campus. He conducted courses in natural philosophy and engineering, and performed groundbreaking experiments in electromagnetic induction that established him at the forefront of the first golden age of science in America.

In **1873**, President James McCosh brought renowned physicist **Cyrus Fogg Brackett** to campus. Along with fellow physicist **William Magie** (Class of 1879) and mathematician **Henry B. Fine** (Class of 1880), Brackett laid a solid academic foundation that would rise to become one of the world's great centers of theoretical physics.

In the 20th century, Princeton's prominence in **relativity theory** influenced **Albert Einstein's** choice of refuge and residence, leading to his long friendship with the University.

Over the last several decades, the Department has expanded into high energy physics, condensed matter physics, mathematical physics, biological physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics. More than **a dozen Nobel Prizes** have been awarded to faculty and students of the Department, highlighting the groundbreaking significance of their work.
