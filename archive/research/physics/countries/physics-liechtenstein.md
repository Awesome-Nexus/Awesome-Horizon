# Physics in Liechtenstein: A Comprehensive Overview

Liechtenstein, one of the world's smallest sovereign states with a population of approximately 39,000, has a unique physics landscape characterized by its close ties to neighboring Switzerland and a focus on science education and outreach rather than large-scale research infrastructure. The Principality does not have dedicated university physics departments or national research laboratories, but maintains an active scientific community through the Liechtenstein Scientific Society and collaborates extensively with Swiss and international institutions.
