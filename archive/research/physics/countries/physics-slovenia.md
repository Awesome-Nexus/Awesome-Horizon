# Physics in Slovenia

## Overview

Slovenia, a Central European nation of approximately 2.1 million people, has a rich tradition in physics research and education dating back to the 19th century. Despite its small size, Slovenia has produced world-renowned physicists and maintains a vibrant physics community centered around the **Jožef Stefan Institute (IJS)**—the country's premier research institution. The nation takes its name from the famous Slovene physicist **Jožef Stefan** (1835–1893), who formulated the Stefan–Boltzmann law of black-body radiation—the only physical law of nature named after a Slovene scientist.

Slovenia's physics landscape is characterized by strong international collaboration, particularly with CERN (Slovenia became a full member state in June 2025), and excellence in areas such as particle physics, condensed matter physics, complex systems, and nuclear physics.
