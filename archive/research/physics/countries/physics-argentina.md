## 1. National Physics Societies

### Asociación Física Argentina (AFA)

The **Argentine Physical Association (AFA)** is the premier professional organization for physicists in Argentina.

**Foundation and History:**
- Founded on **August 27, 1944** by **Enrique Gaviola** and **Guido Beck**
- Established with 26 founding members, 14 of whom were students
- Created during a pivotal moment when physics was beginning to consolidate as a discipline in Argentina
- Initially promoted collaboration between Argentine and Brazilian physicists

**Key Figures in AFA History:**
- **Enrique Gaviola (1900–1989)**: The most remarkable Argentine experimental physicist of the first half of the 20th century; studied under Max Planck in Göttingen
- **Guido Beck (1903–1988)**: Austrian physicist who was Heisenberg's assistant; instrumental in training several generations of Argentine physicists
- **Richard Gans (1880–1954)**: German physicist who directed the Physics Institute at UNLP (1911–1925) and later became president of AFA (1950, though he resigned without assuming)

**Historical Context:**
The AFA emerged during a period of growing recognition of physics' importance for industrial development. It navigated complex relationships with the Perón government (1946–1955), particularly regarding the Huemul Project (a failed controlled fusion initiative) and the creation of the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) in 1950.

### Sociedad de Biofísica de Argentina (SAB)
