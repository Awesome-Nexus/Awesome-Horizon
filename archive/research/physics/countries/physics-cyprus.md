# Physics in Cyprus

## Overview

Cyprus has developed a vibrant and growing physics research ecosystem despite its small geographic size. The country's physics landscape is anchored by the Cyprus Institute, a world-class research center focusing on climate, energy, and computational sciences, and the University of Cyprus, which leads the nation's participation in international particle physics experiments at CERN. With its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, Cyprus serves as a regional hub for scientific collaboration, particularly for the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East (EMME) region. The country has been a CERN Associate Member since 2016 and actively participates in EU research programs, reflecting its strong commitment to international scientific cooperation.
