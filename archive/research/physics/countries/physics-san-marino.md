# Physics in San Marino: A Comprehensive Overview

San Marino, one of the world's smallest countries and the oldest surviving sovereign state and constitutional republic, has a modest but developing scientific research ecosystem. With a population of approximately 34,000, the country has limited dedicated physics infrastructure but maintains physics education through the University of the Republic of San Marino (UNIRSM) and participates in international scientific collaborations, particularly with Italian institutions and through European Union research programs. The country's research focus emphasizes interdisciplinary approaches, with physics applications primarily integrated into engineering, biomedical studies, and technology innovation programs.

## 1. National Physics Societies

San Marino does not have a dedicated national physics society. Given the country's small size, physicists and researchers with physics backgrounds typically participate in international and regional scientific organizations:

### Participation in International Scientific Bodies

| Organization | Type of Participation | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Società Italiana di Fisica (SIF)** | Individual membership | San Marino citizens with physics degrees often join the Italian Physical Society |
| **European Physical Society (EPS)** | Through SIF or individual membership | Access to European physics networks |
| **European Mathematical Society** | Individual membership | For researchers in mathematical physics |

**Note:** Due to San Marino's small size and geographic location within Italy, physicists from the Republic typically engage with Italian scientific societies rather than maintaining separate national organizations.
