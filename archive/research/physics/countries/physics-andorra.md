# Physics in Andorra: A Comprehensive Overview

Andorra, a small landlocked microstate in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain, has a limited but developing scientific research infrastructure. With a population of approximately 80,000 and a focus on tourism, banking, and trade, Andorra's physics landscape is necessarily modest. The University of Andorra (Universitat d'Andorra - UdA), founded in 1988, serves as the country's primary higher education and research institution. While dedicated physics research is limited, the country participates in European academic networks and has growing capabilities in technology, health sciences research, and applied sciences.
