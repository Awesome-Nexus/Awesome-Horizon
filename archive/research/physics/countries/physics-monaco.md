# Physics in Monaco: A Comprehensive Overview

The Principality of Monaco, despite being one of the world's smallest countries (2.02 km²), has developed a unique scientific ecosystem centered on marine research, environmental science, and medical physics. While Monaco does not have a traditional physics department at its university or a dedicated national physics society, it hosts major international research institutions and maintains active collaboration with international physics organizations, particularly through the IAEA and its partnerships with French scientific institutions.
