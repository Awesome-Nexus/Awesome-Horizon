# Physics in Greece

## Overview

Greece has a rich and distinguished tradition in physics dating back to ancient times with philosophers like Democritus, who formulated an early atomic theory of the universe. Modern physics in Greece has developed into a robust scientific enterprise with strong academic institutions, major research centers, and significant international collaborations. Greek physicists have made substantial contributions to particle physics, condensed matter physics, astrophysics, and theoretical physics. The country is a founding member of CERN and maintains active participation in major international physics experiments.
