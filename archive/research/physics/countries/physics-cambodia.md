# Physics in Cambodia: A Comprehensive Overview

Cambodia's physics research and education landscape is undergoing significant development following decades of disruption. The Royal University of Phnom Penh (RUPP), the country's oldest university, houses the primary physics department with growing research capacity in nanomaterials, sensors, and renewable energy. International partnerships, particularly with Sweden through the International Science Programme (ISP) and various ASEAN collaborations, play a crucial role in developing Cambodia's physics capabilities. The government's Cambodia Science, Technology & Innovation (STI) Roadmap 2030 signals increased commitment to building scientific research capacity.

## 1. National Physics Societies

### Current Status

Cambodia does not currently have a dedicated national physics society. Physics professionals are primarily organized through:

#### Cambodian Mathematical Society (CMS)

While focused on mathematics, the Cambodian Mathematical Society provides the closest equivalent professional organization for physics-related academic activities.

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Founded** | 2000s |
| **Type** | Non-profit professional organization |
| **Mission** | Promote mathematical education and research in Cambodia |
| **Membership** | PhD, Master's, and Bachelor's degree holders |
