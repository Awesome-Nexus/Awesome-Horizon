# Physics in Slovakia

## Overview

Slovakia has a rich tradition in physics research and education, dating back to the 18th century with notable physicists like Ján Andrej Segner (1704–1777) and Ányos Jedlik (1800–1895). The modern physics landscape in Slovakia is characterized by strong research institutions, active university physics departments, and significant international collaborations, particularly with CERN. The country's physics research focuses on areas such as nuclear and subnuclear physics, solid state physics, quantum optics, materials science, and environmental physics.

Slovakia joined CERN as an associate member state in 1993 after the peaceful split of Czechoslovakia, continuing the collaborative tradition with this major European research organization. The Slovak physics community is organized primarily through the Slovak Physical Society and maintains strong connections with European physics institutions through the European Physical Society.
