# Physics in Montenegro

## Overview

Montenegro, a small country in Southeast Europe with a population of approximately 620,000, has a developing but vibrant physics research and education ecosystem. Physics in Montenegro has its roots in the post-World War II period, with the establishment of the Higher Pedagogical School in Cetinje in 1947 and later the University of Montenegro in 1974. Despite its small size, Montenegro actively participates in international scientific collaborations, notably with CERN, and maintains active research programs in theoretical and experimental physics through its primary academic institution, the University of Montenegro. The country's physics community is characterized by strong regional cooperation through networks such as SEENET-MTP and active engagement in Balkan and European scientific initiatives.
