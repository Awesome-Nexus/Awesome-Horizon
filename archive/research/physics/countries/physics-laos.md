# Physics in Laos: A Comprehensive Overview

Laos (Lao People's Democratic Republic) has a developing physics research and education ecosystem centered primarily around the National University of Laos (NUOL) in Vientiane. As a landlocked country in Southeast Asia with a population of approximately 7.5 million, Laos faces significant challenges in developing advanced scientific infrastructure, but has established important foundations in physics education and applied research, particularly in geophysics and renewable energy. The country benefits from strong international partnerships, notably through the International Science Programme (ISP) of Sweden and collaborations with neighboring countries.
