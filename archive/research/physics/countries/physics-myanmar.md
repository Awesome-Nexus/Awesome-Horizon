# Physics in Myanmar: A Comprehensive Overview

Myanmar (formerly Burma) has a developing physics research and education ecosystem with strong foundations in higher education institutions dating back to the colonial era. The country's physics landscape is characterized by two major historic universities - the University of Yangon and the University of Mandalay - along with a growing network of regional universities and technological institutes. Despite facing significant challenges due to political instability and economic constraints, Myanmar's physics community continues to pursue research in materials science, nuclear physics, electronics, and astronomy.
