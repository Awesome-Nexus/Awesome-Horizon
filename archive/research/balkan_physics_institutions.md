## Historical Context

The Balkan region has a rich history in physics dating back to the 18th century with **Ruđer Bošković** (Ragusa/Dubrovnik), whose atomic theory predated modern atomic physics. The 19th century saw **Jožef Stefan** (Slovenia) establish fundamental laws of thermal radiation. The late 19th and early 20th centuries produced global icons like **Nikola Tesla** (Serbia) and **Mihajlo Pupin** (Serbia), who revolutionized electrical engineering and telecommunications.

During the Yugoslav period (1945–1991), physics research was organized through state-funded institutes like the **Jožef Stefan Institute** (1949), **Ruđer Bošković Institute** (1950), **Vinča Nuclear Institute** (1948), and **Institute of Physics Belgrade**. These institutes remain the backbone of physics research in the region.

Today, Balkan physicists are actively involved in international collaborations, particularly with **CERN**, **ITER**, and various EU research programs (Horizon Europe). The region continues to produce notable contributions in theoretical physics, condensed matter physics, and materials science.
