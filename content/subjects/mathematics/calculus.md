## 💡 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting the Chain Rule**
   - d/dx[sin(x²)] ≠ cos(x²), it's cos(x²)·2x

2. **Integration Constant**
   - Always + C for indefinite integrals

3. **Sign Errors**
   - Watch negatives when integrating by parts

4. **Domain Issues**
   - ln(x) only defined for x > 0

5. **Confusing Derivative vs Integral**
   - Derivative = rate of change (slope)
   - Integral = accumulation (area)
