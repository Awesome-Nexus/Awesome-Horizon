## 📊 Study Tips

### 1. Focus on Problem-Solving
Physics is learned by doing problems. Read the chapter, then do 20+ problems.

### 2. Draw Diagrams
Always draw a picture. Label forces, velocities, directions.

### 3. Dimensional Analysis
Check units at every step. If you're solving for energy and get kg·m/s, you made a mistake.

### 4. Limiting Cases
Check if your answer makes sense in extreme cases (v→0, v→c, etc.)

### 5. Connect to Intuition
Build physical intuition. Why does a spinning ice skater speed up?

### 6. Study Groups
Work through problems with peers. Explain concepts to each other.
