## Changelog Guidelines

### Version Format

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Change Categories

| **Changed** | Changes to existing functionality |
| **Deprecated** | Features that will be removed in future versions |
| **Removed** | Features that have been removed |
| **Fixed** | Bug fixes and corrections |

### Best Practices

1. **Chronological Order**: Most recent changes appear first
2. **Present Tense**: Use present tense verbs (e.g., "Add" not "Added")
3. **Issue References**: Link to relevant GitHub issues or pull requests
4. **User Impact**: Focus on user-facing changes, not internal refactors
5. **Semantic Grouping**: Group related changes together
